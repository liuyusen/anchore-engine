Security Fix(es): * An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server or to execute arbitrary code in the context of the FreeRADIUS server process by sending a specially crafted request packet. (CVE-2017-10984) * An out-of-bounds read and write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled RADIUS packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted RADIUS packet. (CVE-2017-10978) * An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted DHCP request. (CVE-2017-10983) * A denial of service flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the FreeRADIUS server to enter an infinite loop, consume increasing amounts of memory resources, and ultimately crash by sending a specially crafted request packet. (CVE-2017-10985) * Multiple out-of-bounds read flaws were found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted DHCP request. (CVE-2017-10986, CVE-2017-10987) Red Hat would like to thank the FreeRADIUS project for reporting these issues.
