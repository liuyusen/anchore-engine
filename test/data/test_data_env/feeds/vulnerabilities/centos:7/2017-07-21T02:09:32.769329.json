Graphite can be used to create \"smart fonts\" capable of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors. With respect to the Text Encoding Model, Graphite handles the \"Rendering\" aspect of writing system implementation. The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: graphite2 (1.3.10). Security Fix(es): * Various vulnerabilities have been discovered in Graphite2. An attacker able to trick an unsuspecting user into opening specially crafted font files in an application using Graphite2 could exploit these flaws to disclose potentially sensitive memory, cause an application crash, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
